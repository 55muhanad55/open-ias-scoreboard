The Open IAS Scoreboard Project maintains documentation for its developers and users.

If you have added a feature or made a change that users or other developers should me made aware of, please add it to the documentation. Refer to [Contributing to Documentation](#contributing-to-documentation).

### Contributing to Documentation

Everyone is welcome to contribute to documentation. This is very often a neglected part of open source development so we always need more capable people writing documentation for projects.

The documentation is stored in the same repository as Open IAS Scoreboard in the `docs/` directory.

The documentation uses [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), a static website generator. Refer to the [Hugo website](https://gohugo.io) for instructions on installing and using Hugo.

When your pull request gets merged, documentation changes will be automatically built and made live on <https://openias.garykim.dev>.
